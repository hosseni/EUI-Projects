# Autonomous Car - Light Following & Obstacle Avoidance

## Introduction

This project is an autonomous car that utilizes Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) to follow a light source and an ultrasonic sensor to avoid obstacles. The system is based on the Texas Instruments Tiva C series microcontroller (TivaC) and is programmed using TivaWare. This README provides an overview of the project, hardware requirements, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Features

- **Light Following**: The car autonomously follows a light source by adjusting its direction based on the intensity of light received by LDR sensors.

- **Obstacle Avoidance**: An ultrasonic sensor is used to detect obstacles in the car's path, allowing it to make necessary adjustments to avoid collisions.
